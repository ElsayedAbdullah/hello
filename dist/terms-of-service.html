                <h2>9. Dispute Resolution; Class Action Waiver</h2>
                <p>If we are not able to resolve a legal dispute by negotiation, you agree it will be resolved by binding arbitration or in small claims court.ANY DISPUTE, CLAIM OR CONTROVERSY BETWEEN YOU AND Hello? Caller ID RELATING IN ANY WAY TO THIS AGREEMENT OR YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF THE SERVICES, WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, STATUTE, REGULATION, ORDINANCE, TORT (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, FRAUD, MISREPRESENTATION, FRAUDULENT INDUCEMENT, OR NEGLIGENCE), OR ANY OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY (“DISPUTE”), WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION IF IT CANNOT BE RESOLVED THROUGH NEGOTIATION AS SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION 9. ARBITRATION MEANS THAT THE DISPUTE WILL BE RESOLVED BY A NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR INSTEAD OF IN A COURT BY A JUDGE OR JURY.NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, YOU AND WHITEPAGES AGREE THAT:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>ANY DISPUTE THAT MAY BE BROUGHT IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT MAY BE INSTITUTED IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT IN YOUR COUNTY OF RESIDENCE OR KING COUNTY, WASHINGTON INSTEAD OF BEING RESOLVED THROUGH ARBITRATION, AND</li>
                  <li>
                    EITHER PARTY MAY SEEK INJUNCTIVE RELIEF IN ANY COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION TO:
                    <ul>
                      <li>ENJOIN INFRINGEMENT OR VIOLATION OF ANY DATA USE RESTRICTIONS CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT, OR</li>
                      <li>ENJOIN SCRAPING, WEB CRAWLING OR UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO EITHER PARTY’S WEB SITES OR SERVICES.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>We must try to negotiate resolution of a legal dispute for at least 30 days.</p>
                <p>If you have a Dispute with Hello? Caller ID, you must send written notice describing the Dispute to Hello? Caller ID to allow Hello? Caller ID an opportunity to resolve the Dispute informally through negotiation. Your notice must be sent to the following address: Hello? Caller ID, Inc., Attn: Legal Department, 1301 Fifth Ave, Suite 1600, Seattle, WA 98101. If we have a Dispute with you, we will send written notice (email or letter) describing the Dispute to you. The parties agree to negotiate resolution of a Dispute in good faith for no fewer than 30 days after notice of a Dispute has been provided. If the Dispute is not resolved within 30 days from receipt of notice of the Dispute, you or Hello? Caller ID may proceed to have the Dispute resolved through arbitration as each party’s exclusive Dispute resolution process (except for the limited exceptions set forth above).</p>
                <p>Thereafter, disputes will be resolved by arbitration.</p>
                <p>Any arbitration, if required, will be conducted by Hello? Caller ID under its Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures, and these rules will govern the payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees, unless this Section 9 expressly provides otherwise. If the amount of any claim in an arbitration is US\$10,000 or less, Hello? Caller ID will pay all filing, administration and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration, so long as (i) you make a written request for such payment of fees and submit it to the Hello? Caller ID with your Demand for Arbitration, and (ii) your claim is not determined by the arbitrator to be frivolous. In such case, we will make arrangements to pay all necessary fees directly to the Hello? Caller ID.</p>
                <p>If the amount of the claim exceeds US\$10,000 and you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Hello? Caller ID will pay as much of the filing, administration, and arbitrator fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive as compared to litigation. If the arbitrator determines the claim(s) you assert in the arbitration are frivolous, you agree to reimburse Hello? Caller ID for all fees associated with the arbitration paid by Hello? Caller ID on your behalf, which you otherwise would be obligated to pay under the Hello? Caller ID’s rules.</p>
                <p>The arbitration shall be held in the county in which you reside or at another mutually agreed location. If the value of the relief sought is US\$10,000 or less, either of us may elect to have the arbitration conducted by telephone or based solely on written submissions, which election shall be binding on us subject to the arbitrator’s discretion to require an in-person hearing. Attendance at any in-person hearing may be made by telephone by you and/or us, unless the arbitrator requires otherwise.Neither party may bring a class action lawsuit to resolve a dispute.</p>
                <p>YOU AND Hello? Caller ID EACH WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO CONDUCT DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDINGS IN A CLASS ACTION OR CONSOLIDATED ACTION. YOU AND Hello? Caller ID EACH AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDINGS WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, WITH THE SOLE EXCEPTION OF REPRESENTATIVE SUITS THAT ARE PERMITTED BY, AND DEEMED UNWAIVABLE UNDER, STATE LAW. IF FOR ANY REASON A CLAIM PROCEEDS IN COURT RATHER THAN IN ARBITRATION, WE EACH WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL.</p>
                <p>If any clause within this Section 9 (other than the class action waiver clause above) is determined to be illegal or unenforceable, that clause will be severed from this Section 9, and the remainder of this Section 9 will be given full effect. If the class action waiver clause is determined to be illegal or unenforceable, this entire Section 9 will be unenforceable, and the Dispute will be decided by the courts of the state of Washington, King County, or the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington, and the parties irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts.</p>
                <p>The Federal Arbitration Act, applicable federal law, and the laws of the state of Washington, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern this Agreement and any Dispute that might arise between Whitepages and you.</p>
